## TLibs build dependency

TLibs is a versioned Maven `provided` dependency. From this repository, prepare
it once with the shared installer, then build as usual:

```sh
python3 ../tlibs/tools/install-dependency.py --pom pom.xml
mvn clean verify
```

See [TLibs dependency setup](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/TLibs/blob/61bd61b17fba45e5178612578805d7108596e8a0/DEPENDENCIES.md)
for private-source access, offline installation and the pinned binary versions.
Other declared build dependencies still need their usual preparation.
